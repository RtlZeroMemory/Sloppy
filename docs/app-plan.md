# Sloppy Plan

## Purpose

`app.plan.json` is the compiler/runtime contract. It describes the native host graph that
the runtime validates and builds before user code handles work.

The plan exists so the runtime can dispatch routes natively, audit permissions, validate
configuration, check runtime compatibility, and call JavaScript handlers by numeric ID.

## Scope

This document defines the intended plan v1 shape, validation rules, compatibility rules,
compiler emission rules, implementation tasks, and acceptance criteria for the first plan
loader.

## Non-Goals

The foundation phase does not implement:

- a JSON parser;
- plan loading;
- route matching;
- service graph execution;
- module extraction;
- database providers.

## Current Phase

TASK 06.A implements the minimal native C shape for Plan v1 and adds handwritten valid and
invalid fixtures. The runtime still does not parse, validate, load, or execute
`app.plan.json`.

## Future Phase

TASK 06.B should read a small handwritten plan, validate metadata, and expose a handler
table to the runtime.

## Public API Shape

The plan is not normally user-authored. It is a public compatibility contract for `sloppyc`,
`sloppy`, diagnostics tools, and future package tooling. Users may inspect it through future
commands such as `sloppy audit`, `sloppy routes`, and `sloppy doctor`.

## Versioning Rules

- `schemaVersion` is mandatory in JSON fixtures.
- Runtime must reject plans with unsupported major schema versions.
- Runtime may accept compatible minor additions only if unknown fields are explicitly
  allowed by that schema version.
- Plan must declare runtime minimum version. Feature requirements are future schema work.
- Plan must declare target platform and target engine.
- Compiler version is diagnostic metadata and cache input.
- TASK 06.A supports only schema version `1` through `sl_plan_version_supported`.

## Implemented Minimal Plan v1 Shape

The implemented native C shape in `include/sloppy/plan.h` is deliberately small:

- `schemaVersion` / `SlPlan.version`;
- `compilerVersion` / `SlPlan.compiler_version`;
- `runtimeMinimumVersion` / `SlPlan.runtime_min_version`;
- `stdlibVersion` / `SlPlan.stdlib_version`;
- `target.platform` and `target.engine`;
- `bundle.path`, `bundle.id`, and `bundle.hash`;
- `sourceMap.path`, `sourceMap.id`, and `sourceMap.hash`;
- `handlers[].id`, `handlers[].exportName`, and `handlers[].displayName`.

All native `SlStr` fields are borrowed views. The handler table is borrowed and
caller-owned. The future loader owns copied storage and JSON parser lifetimes.

Handler rules implemented now:

- handler IDs are numeric runtime dispatch keys;
- handler ID `0` is reserved and invalid;
- duplicate handler IDs are invalid plan input;
- handler export names are future engine bridge export names;
- display names are diagnostic/user-facing only.

Unknown field handling is deferred to TASK 06.B because this PR does not parse JSON.

- diagnostics display name.

## File And Module Layout

Likely implementation areas:

```text
include/sloppy/plan.h
src/core/plan.c
src/core/plan_validate.c
tests/golden/plan/
tests/integration/plan/
compiler/src/plan/
```

Do not create parser or validator files without tests.

## Minimal Plan v1 Fixture

Current handwritten fixture shape:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "compilerVersion": "sloppyc-placeholder",
  "runtimeMinimumVersion": "0.1.0",
  "stdlibVersion": "0.1.0",
  "target": {
    "platform": "windows-x64",
    "engine": "v8"
  },
  "bundle": {
    "path": ".sloppy/app.js",
    "id": "app-js-test",
    "hash": "test-only"
  },
  "sourceMap": {
    "path": ".sloppy/app.js.map",
    "id": "app-js-map-test",
    "hash": "test-only"
  },
  "handlers": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "exportName": "__sloppy_handler_1",
      "displayName": "Home"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Future Full Plan

Later schema phases may add routes, modules, services, middleware, filters, schemas, data
providers, capabilities, permissions, diagnostics metadata, and build cache metadata. Those
sections are intentionally absent from TASK 06.A.

Illustrative future shape, not implemented:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "compilerVersion": "sloppyc-placeholder",
  "runtimeMinimumVersion": "0.1.0",
  "stdlibVersion": "0.1.0",
  "target": {
    "platform": "windows-x64",
    "engine": "v8"
  },
  "bundle": {
    "path": ".sloppy/app.js",
    "id": "app-js-placeholder",
    "hash": "sha256-placeholder"
  },
  "sourceMap": {
    "path": ".sloppy/app.js.map",
    "id": "app-js-map-placeholder",
    "hash": "sha256-placeholder"
  },
  "handlers": [
    {
      "id": 100,
      "exportName": "__sloppy_handler_100",
      "displayName": "Users.Get"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [],
  "modules": [],
  "services": [],
  "dataProviders": []
}
```

## Validation Rules

Plan validation must check:

- schema version is supported;
- target platform and engine are supported;
- required features are known;
- bundle and source map fields are present;
- module dependency graph has no cycles;
- module order is deterministic;
- route IDs are unique;
- handler IDs are unique;
- every route handler ID exists;
- every expected handler export/registration name is present during startup;
- route ambiguity is rejected before serving;
- service tokens are unique within allowed scopes;
- data provider tokens match services/capabilities;
- permissions reference known capabilities;
- schema references point to known schemas;
- unsupported dynamic mode is rejected unless explicitly enabled;
- source map presence follows target mode policy;
- no secret values are embedded in plan config.

TASK 06.A does not implement these JSON validation rules. It only provides helper coverage
for supported version checks, handler ID validity, handler lookup, and duplicate handler ID
detection.

## Runtime Compatibility Rules

Runtime rejects a plan when:

- runtime version is below `runtimeMinimumVersion`;
- target engine is not available;
- target platform is incompatible;
- required stdlib version is unavailable;
- required feature is unknown;
- bundle hash does not match;
- expected handler table is not registered.

## Compiler Emission Rules

`sloppyc` must:

- emit deterministic JSON ordering where practical;
- include source locations for user-facing declarations;
- include stable numeric handler IDs;
- avoid secret values;
- emit source map links;
- validate static plan restrictions before writing success artifacts;
- produce golden-testable output.

## Error And Diagnostic Behavior

Plan diagnostics should identify:

- failing section;
- offending token/route/module/handler;
- source location when available;
- machine-readable diagnostic code;
- suggested fix when safe.

Examples:

- duplicate handler ID;
- route references missing handler;
- module dependency cycle;
- missing config key for provider;
- incompatible runtime feature.

## Testing Requirements

Plan tests should include:

- valid minimal plan;
- unsupported schema version;
- missing bundle;
- missing source map;
- duplicate handler ID;
- missing handler export.

Future parser/validator phases should add:

- route missing handler;
- module cycle;
- invalid provider token;
- permissions referencing unknown capability;
- golden full plan fixture.

## Quality Gates

- plan fixture tests run in CTest;
- golden plan fixtures are stable;
- malformed plans produce diagnostics, not crashes;
- no secrets appear in checked-in plan fixtures;
- plan schema changes update this document and ADRs when architectural.

## Implementation Tasks

- Define C structs for parsed plan model.
- Add minimal plan fixture directory.
- Choose JSON parser in the appropriate phase.
- Add validator with section-specific diagnostics.
- Add handler table extraction.
- Add plan/bundle consistency checks.
- Add golden tests for JSON fixtures.
- Add CTest integration for valid and invalid plans.
- Add schema section fixtures before validation API lands.
- Add dynamic mode rejection fixture.

## Acceptance Criteria For Plan v1 Loader

Plan v1 loader is accepted when:

- runtime can load a minimal handwritten plan;
- validator rejects malformed required sections;
- handler table is exposed to later runtime code;
- diagnostics identify section and source location where available;
- tests cover success and failure fixtures;
- no V8, HTTP, compiler extraction, or database provider code is required.

## Open Questions

- Exact numeric ID allocation strategy.
- Whether plan JSON permits comments in dev mode.
- Whether unknown fields are warnings or errors in v1.
- Exact source location representation for generated module contributions.
