## Goal
Deliver HTTP Router Foundation as medium-sized bounded-context PRs.

## Non-goals
- No future-phase expansion.
- No unrelated runtime, compiler, provider, or package-manager work.

## Scope
- Add route pattern parser/matcher, then HTTP integration only when dependencies are allowed.
- Each task must preserve source-doc boundaries and quality gates.

## Task Breakdown
- TASK 10.A: Route Pattern Parser and Matcher
- TASK 10.B: llhttp/libuv Integration Skeleton when Dependencies Are Allowed
- TASK 10.C: GET Route Dispatch to Handler ID

## Suggested PR Grouping
Prefer one PR per listed task. Combine only when the result remains one coherent bounded context.

## Files Likely Touched
- See task files for exact paths.
- Keep generated/build artifacts out of source control.
- Update docs/ADRs when behavior or architecture changes.

## Tests Required
- Run standard Windows workflow where applicable.
- Add or update CTest/golden/snapshot/cargo tests for implementation tasks.
- For spec-only tasks, explain why tests did not change.

## Quality Gates
- Read AGENTS.md and source docs first.
- No OS APIs outside src/platform/*.
- No V8 types outside src/engine/v8/*.
- No JS raw native pointers.
- No package-manager or Node compatibility assumptions.
- Run available gates and report commands honestly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All listed task issues exist or are intentionally deferred.
- PRs map to bounded-context tasks.
- Docs, tests, and quality gates match the source docs.
- No future-phase implementation lands from this EPIC before prerequisites are met.

## Risks
- Scope creep into later runtime features.
- Docs and issue bodies drifting apart.
- Missing tests on implementation slices.

## Deferred Decisions
- See task follow-up sections and docs/tech-debt-tracker.md.

## Reviewer Focus
- Confirm boundaries and non-goals.
- Confirm task sizing is bounded.
- Confirm checks and tests match the risk of the slice.

- type:epic
- area:http
