# EPIC-06: Plan Schema and Loader

## Milestone
0.2 Runtime Contract

## Summary

## Goal
Load and validate a minimal handwritten app.plan.json and expose handler table data for later execution.

## Non-goals
- No HTTP route matching.
- No V8 execution.
- No compiler extraction.
- No data providers.

## Scope
- Plan v1 schema and native structs.
- JSON parser/validator when dependency is approved.
- Golden plan fixtures.

## Task Breakdown
- TASK 06.A: Plan v1 Schema and Native Structs
- TASK 06.B: Plan JSON Parser / Validator
- TASK 06.C: Golden Plan Fixtures

## Suggested PR Grouping
Prefer one PR per listed task. Combine only when the result remains one coherent bounded context.

## Files Likely Touched
- See task files for exact paths.
- Keep generated/build artifacts out of source control.
- Update docs/ADRs when behavior or architecture changes.

## Tests Required
- Run standard Windows workflow where applicable.
- Add or update CTest/golden/snapshot/cargo tests for implementation tasks.
- For spec-only tasks, explain why tests did not change.

## Quality Gates
- Read AGENTS.md and source docs first.
- No OS APIs outside src/platform/*.
- No V8 types outside src/engine/v8/*.
- No JS raw native pointers.
- No package-manager or Node compatibility assumptions.
- Run available gates and report commands honestly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All listed task issues exist or are intentionally deferred.
- PRs map to bounded-context tasks.
- Docs, tests, and quality gates match the source docs.
- No future-phase implementation lands from this EPIC before prerequisites are met.

## Risks
- Scope creep into later runtime features.
- Docs and issue bodies drifting apart.
- Missing tests on implementation slices.

## Deferred Decisions
- See task follow-up sections and docs/tech-debt-tracker.md.

## Reviewer Focus
- Confirm boundaries and non-goals.
- Confirm task sizing is bounded.
- Confirm checks and tests match the risk of the slice.
