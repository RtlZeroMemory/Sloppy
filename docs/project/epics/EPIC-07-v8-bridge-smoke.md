# EPIC-07: V8 Bridge Smoke

## Milestone
0.2 Runtime Contract

## Summary
Initialize V8 and call trivial JS through an isolated C++ bridge without leaking V8 types.

## Goal
Prove the engine boundary and owner-thread assumptions with a minimal smoke path.

## Non-goals
- No runtime app execution.
- No HTTP.
- No TypeScript compilation.
- No public JS API bootstrap beyond bridge smoke.

## Scope
- V8 SDK detection/build integration.
- Engine-neutral C ABI.
- Load JS and call exported function.
- Exception mapping skeleton.

## Task Breakdown
- TASK 07.A: V8 SDK Detection and Build Integration
- TASK 07.B: Isolated Engine C ABI
- TASK 07.C: Load JS and Call Exported Function
- TASK 07.D: Exception Mapping Skeleton

## Suggested PR Grouping
Prefer one PR per listed task. Combine only when the result remains one coherent bounded context.

## Files Likely Touched
- See task files for exact paths.
- Keep generated/build artifacts out of source control.
- Update docs/ADRs when behavior or architecture changes.

## Tests Required
- Run standard Windows workflow where applicable.
- Add or update CTest/golden/snapshot/cargo tests for implementation tasks.
- For spec-only tasks, explain why tests did not change.

## Quality Gates
- Read AGENTS.md and source docs first.
- No OS APIs outside src/platform/*.
- No V8 types outside src/engine/v8/*.
- No JS raw native pointers.
- No package-manager or Node compatibility assumptions.
- Run available gates and report commands honestly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All listed task issues exist or are intentionally deferred.
- PRs map to bounded-context tasks.
- Docs, tests, and quality gates match the source docs.
- No future-phase implementation lands from this EPIC before prerequisites are met.

## Risks
- Scope creep into later runtime features.
- Docs and issue bodies drifting apart.
- Missing tests on implementation slices.

## Deferred Decisions
- See task follow-up sections and docs/tech-debt-tracker.md.

## Reviewer Focus
- Confirm boundaries and non-goals.
- Confirm task sizing is bounded.
- Confirm checks and tests match the risk of the slice.

- type:epic
- area:engine-v8
