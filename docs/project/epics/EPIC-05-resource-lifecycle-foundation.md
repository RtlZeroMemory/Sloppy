# EPIC-05: Resource Lifecycle Foundation

## Milestone
0.1 Native Core

## Summary
Add generation-counted resource IDs and lifecycle tracking so future JS-visible handles never expose raw pointers.

## Goal
Provide the safe resource lifecycle kernel needed for engine, data, capability, and async work.

## Non-goals
- No real file/db/socket resources.
- No JS bridge integration.
- No provider implementation.

## Scope
- Resource table.
- Kind validation.
- Generation counters.
- Close/reuse behavior.
- Scope/lifetime and leak-tracking skeleton.

## Task Breakdown
- TASK 05.A: Resource Table
- TASK 05.B: Scope / Lifetime Skeleton

## Suggested PR Grouping
One PR may be large-coherent when it delivers the named foundation as a complete, tested building block.

## Files Likely Touched
- See task files for exact paths.
- Keep generated/build artifacts out of source control.
- Update docs/ADRs when behavior or architecture changes.

## Tests Required
- Run standard Windows workflow where applicable.
- Add or update CTest/golden/snapshot/cargo tests for implementation tasks.
- For spec-only tasks, explain why tests did not change.

## Quality Gates
- Read AGENTS.md and source docs first.
- No OS APIs outside src/platform/*.
- No V8 types outside src/engine/v8/*.
- No JS raw native pointers.
- No package-manager or Node compatibility assumptions.
- Run available gates and report commands honestly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All listed task issues exist or are intentionally deferred.
- PRs map to bounded-context tasks.
- Docs, tests, and quality gates match the source docs.
- No future-phase implementation lands from this EPIC before prerequisites are met.

## Risks
- Scope creep into later runtime features.
- Docs and issue bodies drifting apart.
- Missing tests on implementation slices.

## Deferred Decisions
- See task follow-up sections and docs/tech-debt-tracker.md.

## Reviewer Focus
- Confirm boundaries and non-goals.
- Confirm task sizing is bounded.
- Confirm checks and tests match the risk of the slice.
